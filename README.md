# Neural-Net-from-Scratch

This repository is for, as the name sugests, a Neural Network made from scratch with no libraries like Tensor Flow or Keras. This neural net was created during Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree, and every step is well explained in Jupyter Notebooks. The network is used for predicting bike renting rates.
